## Usage

This application should be used to create simple notes. To start the application the user must select the "Get Started" button:

![homepage](./public/assets/images/homepage.png)

The user is then directed to a new html page where they can enter the notes title and the note itself. After entering the information the user can then select the save button:

![new-note-page](./public/assets/images/NewNote.png)

![save-new-note](./public/assets/images/save.png)

Once saved, the page can be refreshed and the new note reflects on the left hand side:

![new-note](./public/assets/images/saved.png)

The user can then delete a note by selecting the red trash can to the right of the note:

![delete-note](./public/assets/images/deleted.png)

Once done, the application can be refreshed and the note will no longer appear:

![note-page](./public/assets/images/NewNote.png)
